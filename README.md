# CG-Project
This project relies heavily on VTK.js: a conversion of C++'s VTK library for JavaScript.
JavaScript is a completely foreign language for us, and thus, a steep learning curve was encountered, however, a history of dealing
with both HTML and CSS proved helpful in initializing the UI.
Moving on, most of the code was available on VTK's website; the challenge was assembling the code in the aforementioned foreign language,
following this, we had to connect the buttons initialized in the UI to the functions. This, however, was quickly solved, and we even
managed to delve into the bonus tasks; the first task was easy to implement, the second, however, proved too challenging for our 
current JS knowledge and the given time-frame.

Below are some screenshots from the app:
